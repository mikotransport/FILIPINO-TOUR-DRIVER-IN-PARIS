            <h3>Eiffel Tower</h3>
            <p>The Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed by critics, the 330-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline.</p>

            <h3>Musée du Louvre</h3>
            <p>The most prestigious museum in Paris, the Louvre ranks among the top European collections of fine arts. Many of Western Civilization's most famous works are found here, including the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, the Wedding Feast at Cana by Veronese, and the 1st-century-BC Venus de Milo sculpture.</p>

            <h3>Château de Versailles</h3>
            <p>The UNESCO-listed Château de Versailles immerses you in France's glorious regal history. Step back in time to the era of the ancien régime, when Louis XIV (the "Sun King"), Louis XV, and Louis XVI ruled France. During that period, the Palace of Versailles set the standard for princely courts in Europe.</p>

            <h3>Gardens at the Palace of Versailles</h3>
            <p>Beyond the formal gardens is the Domaine de Trianon, which includes Le Grand Trianon palace; Le Petit Trianon château; and Le Hameau de la Reine (The Queen's Hamlet), Marie-Antoinette's fabricated pastoral village featuring quaint cottages set around a lake.</p>

            <h3>Côte d'Azur</h3>
            <p>The most fashionable stretch of coastline in France, the Côte d'Azur extends from Saint-Tropez to Menton near the border with Italy. Côte d'Azur translates to "Coast of Blue," a fitting name to describe the Mediterranean's mesmerizing cerulean waters.</p>

            <h3>Castles of the Loire Valley</h3>
            <p>Traveling through the Loire Valley gives the impression of stepping into a children's storybook. Turreted fairy-tale castles grace a luxuriant countryside of dense woodlands and gently flowing rivers. The entire Loire Valley, an area known as the "Garden of France," is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>

            <p>Last year, my husband and I had an amazing European trip, starting in Paris and then heading to the stunning landscapes of Switzerland. Miko, 
                our fantastic guide, made the journey memorable with his humor and knowledge.  If you want someone to show you Europe who is funny, knowledgeable, 
                and personable, then you want Miko. He made our visit to Europe a most memorable experience. We were very very comfortable exploring the two country with him. 
                We felt like we had made a new friend. He was great! Really! Someday we hope to return for another country in europe to visit, and when we do, Miko will be our top choice for a driver and companion.</p>

                <p>We just got back from the most wonderful 7-day European adventure! We spent 3 fantastic days in Paris, 
                    followed by 2 blissful days in Barcelona, and wrapped it up with another 2 days exploring Berlin. 
                    Our driver was an absolute gem— He's so kind, friendly, and willing to go the extra mile to make sure we were happy. 
                    We felt safe and the car was so clean and  also super comfy. Honestly, we couldn't have dreamed of a better service.<br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
